      <description>Daryl Bem did not literally explode peoples brains, but his proofs of the possibility shook psychology to the core. In a short and precise paper in 2011 Bem set out to show that there was good evidence for the existence of human pre-cognition. Paradoxical as it sounds he succeeded. His research coincided with the burgeoning realisation that there was a replication crisis in psychology, yet he presented his work as invitation to further replication.</description>

      <description>The paper explores some the constructive themes in probability modelling. We discuss briefly the notion of construct validity and replicability in psychological science, before turning to a more pernicious example in the algorithm of expected value and the modelling of personal utility. Focusing first on how the probability measures and utility curves are constructed, and the role of these constructions in both Von Neumann &amp;amp; Morgenstern&amp;rsquo;s and Jeffrey&amp;rsquo;s famous representation theorems, we elaborate the difficult choices and idealisations that go into this paradigm of reasoning, and briefly compare how similar choices are made today in machine learning models throughout industry.</description>
