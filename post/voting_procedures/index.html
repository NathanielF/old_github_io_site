          <p>Why Philosophy? What else has the breadth and ambition to assess and grapple with the contemporary scene? It is the endeavour best positioned between demands of intellectual rigour and moral imagination. Its tools encompass logic and probabilistic reasoning, thought experiments, just-so stories, rhetorical flourish and literary style. It dabbles in all the domains of the special sciences seeking patterns and fruitful abstractions. Yet the sum of a particular philosophy is not any linear combination of the above. It is a more nebulous emergent whole based on a multifaceted engagement with a tangled weave of problems. A rotating perspective around a central pivot at fluctuating degrees of magnification. The best examples are rich and exacting, uninhibited by disciplinary provincialism, unified by style and focus. Cavell called it education for grownups, an eternal project. Sellars claimed</p>

<p>&ldquo;The aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the absurdly audacious scale of the endeavour. There are doubters, certainly. Questions of progress - Is it even possible? These are outliers indulged by a discipline temperamentally inclined to scepticism and self-doubt. Individuals make piecemeal steps forward. Intellectual frameworks fixed up, polished and then shelved. The ebb and flow of political movements and fashionable trends subsume these contributions, which are only rescued from obscurity or irrelevance by later traditions. The questions of progress in philosophy is not simply about individuals converging on an answer in the moment, but rather of a society digesting the implications of the facts cast into relief. Sometimes we choke on the revelations. This too is progress.</p>
