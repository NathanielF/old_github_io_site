<p>In 1944 Trygve Haavelmo could argue sincerely that the hostility to mathematical statistics in economics was a mistake. He could argue that, in fact, economic questions <em>could</em> be phrased in the language of probability. Today that observation is palpably anachronistic, owing to the current trend of equating economists with soothsayers while expecting similar arcana and spell craft. The reality falls short of magic and is more interesting than the fantasy.</p>

<h1 id="structural-and-random-components-in-autonomous-laws">Structural and Random Components in Autonomous Laws</h1>

<p>Haavelmo was no hierophant. He locates the difficulty of economics primarily in simple worldly hierarchicies and the contingent nature of economic laws. The modest goal of economics is to formulate somewhat &ldquo;autonomous&rdquo; laws of behaviour, laws which can stand on their own right without dependence on circumstance and prior theoretical commitments. However the degree of autonomy in heretofore discovered laws of economics is low. Persistent predictable behaviour is plagued by weak wills and whimsy, while even the measurements of behaviour is refracted and often indirect. Broadly most economic laws are postulated to have the following form:</p>

<p>$$ (LN): \text{ } y_{i} = f_{i}(\underbrace{x_{1}, x_{2}&hellip;x_{n}}_{\text{ structural vars}}) + \underbrace{\epsilon_{i}}_{error} $$</p>

<p>Imagine that $y_{i}$ is the individual&rsquo;s value for a given product based on the descriptive features of that product $(x_{1}, x_{2} &hellip; x_3)$, and that we want to postulate a law of value or price discovery across all individuals in the market. The value distribution can vary with the individual $i$ due to differences in either (a) how the structural variables enter in the individual&rsquo;s value function and (b) the unexplained or random error, but Haavelmo will argue this is to the good when understood from the perspective of probability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[I]t seems rational to introduce the assumptions about the stochastical elements of our economic theoreies already in the &ldquo;laws&rdquo; of behaviour for the single individuals, firms, etc, as a characteristic of their behaviour and derive the average market relations or relations for the whole society, from the individual &ldquo;laws&rdquo;. It will then, for example, in many cases be possible to show that even under very weak assumptions about the distribution of the stochastical elements in these individual relations, the derived average or total relations for the whole market or the whole society will be characterised by certain compound stochastical variables (e.g. sums of individual error terms), which by the law of large numbers will be approximately <em>normally</em> distributed - <em>The Probability Approach in Economics</em> pg52</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aggregation alone potentially solves issues for individual differences in (b), but the more fundamental issue stems from (a) and the deeply nested structure of the measurement schemes behind $(LN)$. If $y$ is a function of the vector $\mathbf{x}$, which in turn is a function of observations $\mathbf{z}$ &hellip; etc. If it&rsquo;s &ldquo;laws&rdquo; all the way down, the autonomy of $(LN)$ is proportionally weaker for each layer of dependence! A simple change in circumstance might break the dependency of $x_1$ on the ancillary $z_{3}$ and the original &ldquo;equation <em>might</em> still hold after such a break, but that would have to follow from another model&rdquo;.</p>

<p>$$ y_{i} = f_{i}(\underbrace{x_{1}, x_{2}&hellip;x_{n}}_{\text{ structural vars}}) + \underbrace{\epsilon_{i}}_{error} $$</p>

<p>$$  x_{1} = f_{i}(\underbrace{z_{1}, z_{2}&hellip;z_{n}}_{\text{ structural vars}}) +  \underbrace{\epsilon_{i}}_{error} $$ &hellip; and so on</p>

<p>Assume the class of individuals splits on the basic techniques for measuring $z_{3}$, then we might (with enough data) discover two naturally bifurcated populations and derive two laws $(LN_{1}), (LN_{2})$ for two distinct patterns of behaviour. Alternatively, if there is a final authoritative measure of $z_{3}$ we might hope to subsume the two heterogenous populations under one law by aligning on the measurement scheme. Or if we&rsquo;re lucky $(LN)$ alone might be sufficiently rich that the differences over $z_3$ washes out. The art of theory construction is to find those relationships which are approximately invariant in the domain deployed. We might build the theory based on data from one domain, but the test of the theory involves its extension to other domains in which it might fail.</p>

<p>The testing of the theory depends on how we make the notion of &ldquo;approximate&rdquo; precise, if we allow that our hypothesis is one of only one possible instantiation of the systematic or structural relationships than we very quickly falsify our theory against any incompatible data. If we&rsquo;re more generous and allow other instantiations, then we can judge the credibility of our hypotheses versus of liklihood of the data were an alternative true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The essential thing is, therefore, <em>not</em> the way in which we choose the hypothesis to be tested. Essential is what we <em>know</em> or <em>believe</em> to be the class of a priori admissable hypotheses, and what power our test has of rejecting the hypothesis tested, if a &ldquo;really different&rdquo; one among the alternatives be true&rdquo; <em>The Probability Approach in Economics</em> pg83</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="timeseries-forecasting-and-structural-equations">Timeseries Forecasting and Structural Equations</h1>

<p>Forecasting is just a special case of Haavelmo&rsquo;s probabilisic approach to economic theory. Like before we want to derive a probability model which can express claims about the distribution and relationship amongst a set of economic indicators. The discovery of a prediction function amounts to derivation of a clear &ldquo;law&rdquo; which accurately fits the data in recent observed samples in a way that captures the time-dependent structure of trends and seasonal effects, can be projected reliably into the future. The key assumption is that the available sample exhibits sufficiently representative pattern of the series that an inference can be derived from the implict probability model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[A]nother, more precise way of stating that, in order to be able to predict there must be a certain persistence in the type of mechanism that produced the series to be predicted - <em>The Probability Approach in Economics</em> pg107</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We might start with a theory that GDP is a function of investment and consumption like the following:</p>

<p>$$ GDP_{t} = con_{t} + inv_{t} $$
$$ con_{t} = \alpha GDP_{t-1} + \epsilon_{ct}   \text{ where  } 0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1 $$
$$ inv_{t} = \beta(c_{t} - c_{t-1}) + \epsilon_{it} \text{ where  } \beta &gt; 0 $$</p>

<p>This is a system of linear stochastical equations with structural parameters which are to be estimated, and there are a number of complicated techniques used to estimate such a system, but we can in this case simplify the question a little. Substitute $con_{t}$ in the equation for $inv_{t}$ and we get:</p>

<p>$$ inv_{t} = \beta\alpha GDP_{t-1} + \beta\epsilon_{ct} - \beta c_{t-1} + \epsilon_{it}$$</p>

<p>and then since $con_{t-1} = \alpha GDP_{t-2} + \epsilon_{ct-1}$</p>

<p>$$ inv_{t} = \beta\alpha GDP_{t-1} + \beta\epsilon_{ct} - \beta(\alpha GDP_{t-2} + \epsilon_{ct-1}) + \epsilon_{it}$$</p>

<p>This is called a reduced form equation for investment. Since we have removed the dependency of predicting a variable at time $t$ on in system observations at time $t$, the forecast can be generated entirely from prior observations and the shocks or random components of prior events.
A similar consolidation can be done for GDP since:</p>

<p>$$GDP_{t} = \alpha GDP_{t-1} + \epsilon_{ct} + \beta\alpha GDP_{t-1} + \beta\epsilon_{ct} - \beta(\alpha GDP_{t-2} + \epsilon_{ct-1}) + \epsilon_{it} $$</p>

<p>Which means that we ought to be able to estimate current GDP conditional on the past distribution of GDP using the techniques of univariate timeseries forecasting to establish the values of the fixed parameters $\alpha, \beta$ There are no guarantees that the above model will be perfect, but we can at least determine whether it&rsquo;s a good fit to past data, and then further test whether it maintains reasonable predictive accuracy into the future. We make the notion of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; precise by postulating a theoretical distributions for the error terms $\epsilon_{i}, \epsilon_{c}$ and $GDP$ in the above equations. If the data appears consistent with the hypothetical mutlivariate distribution, then the expected value of that theoretical distribution is deemed a reasonable fit. The pattern is common is many economic problems - we start with some notion of the interaction between various structural variables and need to express the system in a manner which (a) preserves some of the knowledge we have of the system and makes (b) makes for a tractable probability model. From there we evaluate competing theories, revise and repeat.</p>

<h2 id="bayesian-probability-modelling-a-brief-example-in-code">Bayesian Probability Modelling: A brief example in Code</h2>

<p>The Bayesian framework while less geared towards hypothesis testing also makes heavy use of probability models. Here the focus is to derive estimates for our structural parameters from the data that we have, to date, observed. We&rsquo;ll show an example of a timeseries with a clear breakage and how the break in the series can be handled if we update the underlying probability model.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>These pieces, so familiar today, were strikingly innovative when first tied into a system. Haavelmo&rsquo;s novel contribution is to explicitly frame the problems as of economics as ones which <em>can</em> be interrogated by using probability theory and statistical inference informed by data. A proposed autonomous &ldquo;law&rdquo; may be made precise by means of a probability model under which we can test a variety of hypotheses against observed data. He distinguished clearly &ldquo;the stream of experiments that Nature is steadily turning out from her own enormous laboratory, and which we merely watch as passive observers&rdquo; from ones we might orchestrate, and then advocated the testing of hypothetical models against this flood of data.(pg14). The dynamic is crucial. The specification of theory allows for tests against data and the past data allows us to formulate new theories. Nature is always providing natural experiments against which to test the theories derived from her previous largesse. It&rsquo;s not magic and there are no incantations, but there is a reverence for the bounty of Nature.</p>
