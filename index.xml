      <description>Most days we face an infinite horizon of future decisions without being overwhelmed. They are all layered under levels uncertainty. A sequence of such decisions can compound, or reduce that certainty. But we tend to focus on the exaggerated drama of the momentous choice. Even when change is gradual and cumulative, history tells of a tale of pivot points, epic junctures and transformative events. Two paths diverge in a woods and we choose one.</description>

      <title>Wheat from Chaff: Maximum Entropy and Information</title>

      <description>There is a rumour of ignorant fish; so involved in the ocean they fail to notice the water around them, what it is and what it could be. There is another cliche about the internet and its denizens drowning in information. There is something to both these images, but the second is too charitable. It suggests a light consistency to the viscous texture of the flow, instead of the congealed sludge that drips down our throat choking off the air.</description>

      <description>In The Century of Self Adam Curtis&amp;rsquo; spiralling survey of the 20th century we&amp;rsquo;re shown how the Freud&amp;rsquo;s ideas seeped into public consciousness. How they were taken and deployed by ad-men and marketing gurus to sell our own initimated desires back to ourselves. There is a conceit of individuality and uniqueness - that our mind is our own and the choices we make are ours alone to know and learn from.</description>

      <description>Demand curve analysis is the academic study of tolerable robbery and stock market manias spike demand curves. You&amp;rsquo;ve likely seen the cobweb like diagrams that chart the trajectories of supply and demand as a function of price. These are aids to estimate the depth of your pockets. Acceptable elascticities of pricing always emerge as a consequence of tolerable changes in demand. A pricing strategy is a question of latitude, how far can we stretch your budget to account for &amp;ldquo;surplus value&amp;rdquo;?</description>

      <title>Haavelmo&#39;s Autonomous laws in Econometrics</title>
      <link>https://nathanielf.github.io/post/forecasting_grue_timeseries/</link>

      <description>In 1944 Trygve Haavelmo could argue sincerely that the hostility to mathematical statistics in economics was a mistake. He could argue that, in fact, economic questions could be phrased in the language of probability. Today that observation is palpably anachronistic, owing to the current trend of equating economists with soothsayers while expecting similar arcana and spell craft. The reality falls short of magic and is more interesting than the fantasy.</description>

      <title>Factor Analysis and Construct Validity in Psychology</title>
      <link>https://nathanielf.github.io/post/theoretical_risks_meehl/</link>

      <description>In a prescient paper in the 1970s Paul Meehl wrote about the lack of cumulative success in the psychologocial sciences, and how this should be attributed to poor methodology rather than the sheer difficulty of the subject. He elaborates an impressive list of problems for modeling any psychological process. Common themes criss-cross the list and interact with one another in ways which could make you despair for the discipline. So it is, I think, somewhat surprising that Meehl locates the main problem not in the subject, but in the method of significance testing.</description>

      <description>Daryl Bem did not literally explode peoples brains, but his proofs of the possibility shook psychology to the core. In a short and precise paper Feeling the Future Bem set out to show that there was good evidence for the existence of human pre-cognition. Paradoxical as it sounds he succeeded. His research coincided with the burgeoning realisation that there was a replication crisis in psychology, yet he presented his work as invitation to further replication.</description>
