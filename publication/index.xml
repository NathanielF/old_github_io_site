      <description>Most days we face an infinite horizon of future decisions without being overwhelmed. They are all layered under levels uncertainty. A sequence of such decisions can compound, or reduce that certainty. But we tend to focus on the exaggerated drama of the momentous choice. Even when change is gradual and cumulative, history tells of a tale of pivot points, epic junctures and transformative events. Two paths diverge in a woods and we choose one.</description>

      <description>There is a rumour of ignorant fish; so involved in the ocean they fail to notice the water around them, what it is and what it could be. There is another cliche about the internet and its denizens drowning in information. There is something to both these images, but the second is too charitable. It suggests a light consistency to the viscous texture of the flow, instead of the congealed sludge that drips down our throat choking off the air.</description>

      <description>Daryl Bem did not literally explode peoples brains, but his proofs of the possibility shook psychology to the core. In a short and precise paper Feeling the Future Bem set out to show that there was good evidence for the existence of human pre-cognition. Paradoxical as it sounds he succeeded. His research coincided with the burgeoning realisation that there was a replication crisis in psychology, yet he presented his work as invitation to further replication.</description>
