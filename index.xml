      <description>In a prescient paper in the 1970s Paul Meehl wrote about the lack of cumulative success in the psychologocial sciences, and how this should be attributed to poor methodology rather than the sheer difficulty of the subject. He was not trying to denigrate the difficulty which the psychologist faces. To make the point clear he elaborates an impressive list of problems for any model of a psychological process. There are a few common themes and some of the problems interact with one another in ways which could make you despair for the discipline.</description>

      <title>Utility and Representation Theorems</title>

      <description>The paper explores some the constructive themes in probability modelling. We discuss briefly the notion of construct validity and replicability in psychological science, before turning to a more pernicious example in the algorithm of expected value and the modelling of personal utility. Focusing first on how the probability measures and utility curves are constructed, and the role of these constructions in both Von Neumann &amp;amp; Morgenstern&amp;rsquo;s and Jeffrey&amp;rsquo;s famous representation theorems, we elaborate the difficult choices and idealisations that go into this paradigm of reasoning, and briefly compare how similar choices are made today in machine learning models throughout industry.</description>
