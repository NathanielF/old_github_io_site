      <description>In a prescient paper in the 1970s Paul Meehl wrote about the lack of cumulative success in the psychologocial sciences, and how this should be attributed to poor methodology rather the sheer difficulty of the subject. This is not to denigrate the difficulty which the psychologist faces. To make the point he elaborates an impressive list of problems for any model of a psychological process. There are a few common themes and some of the problems interact with one another in ways which could make you despair for the discipline.</description>

      <description>Why Philosophy? What else has the breadth and ambition to assess and grapple with the contemporary scene? It is the endeavour best positioned between demands of intellectual rigour and moral imagination. Its tools encompass logic and probabilistic reasoning, thought experiments, just-so stories, rhetorical flourish and literary style. It dabbles in all the domains of the special sciences seeking patterns and fruitful abstractions. Yet the sum of a particular philosophy is not any linear combination of the above.</description>
