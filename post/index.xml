      <description>The post explores some the constructive themes in probability modelling. We discuss briefly the notion of construct validity and replicability in psychological science, before turning to a more pernicious example in the algorithm of expected value and the modelling of personal utility. Focusing first on how the probability measures and utility curves are constructed, and the role of these constructions in both Von Neumann &amp;amp; Morgenstern&amp;rsquo;s and Jeffrey&amp;rsquo;s famous representation theorems, we elaborate the difficult choices and idealisations that go into this paradigm of reasoning, and briefly compare how similar choices are made today in machine learning models throughout industry.</description>

      <title>Why Philosophy?</title>

      <description>Why Philosophy? What else has the breadth and ambition to assess and grapple with the contemporary scene? It is the endeavour best positioned between demands of intellectual rigour and moral imagination. Its tools encompass logic and probabilistic reasoning, thought experiments, just-so stories, rhetorical flourish and literary style. It dabbles in all the domains of the special sciences seeking patterns and fruitful abstractions. Yet the sum of a particular philosophy is not any linear combination of the above.</description>
