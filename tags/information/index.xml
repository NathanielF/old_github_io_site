      <description>Most days we face an infinite horizon of future decisions without being overwhelmed. They are all layered under levels uncertainty. A sequence of such decisions can compound, or reduce that certainty. But we tend to focus on the exaggerated drama of the momentous choice. Even when change is gradual and cumulative, history tells of a tale of pivot points, epic junctures and transformative events. Two paths diverge in a woods and we choose one.</description>

      <description>There is a rumour of ignorant fish; so involved in the ocean they fail to notice the water around them, what it is and what it could be. There is another cliche about the internet and its denizens drowning in information. There is something to both these images, but the second is too charitable. It suggests a light consistency to the viscous texture of the flow, instead of the congealed sludge that drips down our throat choking off the air.</description>
