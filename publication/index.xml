      <description>The post explores some the constructive themes in probability modelling. We discuss briefly the notion of construct validity and replicability in psychological science, before turning to a more pernicious example in the algorithm of expected value and the modelling of personal utility. Focusing first on how the probability measures and utility curves are constructed, and the role of these constructions in both Von Neumann &amp;amp; Morgenstern&amp;rsquo;s and Jeffrey&amp;rsquo;s famous representation theorems, we elaborate the difficult choices and idealisations that go into this paradigm of reasoning, and briefly compare how similar choices are made today in machine learning models throughout industry.</description>
